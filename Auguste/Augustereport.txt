First of all we had to design 2 Gaussian Process Regressor. One for the function f and one for v. Using the given parameters in the project description we build 2 kernel. The kernel of F is composed of 3 differents kernel. One Matern kernel combine (product) with a ConstantKernel for the variance, combine (sum) with a WhiteKernel for the noise. The kernel of V is similar but we add a ConstantKernel (sum) in order to define a mean for our gaussian process regressor.
For the aquisition function we tested 2 different method. The first method we tested was the UCB (Upper Confidence Bound). But based on the paper "Practical Bayesian Optimization of Machine
Learning Algorithms" of Jasper Snoek and al we decided to implement the EI acquistion function, combined with the PI acquisition function. PI is applied on V and if the probability of improvment is higher than 1/2 we compute the expected improvment of F and combine (product) both result. If the PI of V is less than 1/2 we just return this value.
Finally when we have to get the final solution we first filter all the results and keep only those where v is higher than the minimum v = 1.2. Then, on the remaining value we take the x for which the f is the higher. We return that x
